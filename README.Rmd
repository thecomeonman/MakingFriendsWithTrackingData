## Before you begin:

Before attempting to run this code, follow the instructions at 
https://github.com/thecomeonman/CodaBonito to install some dependencies.

Also get the tracking data, recently made public as part of the Friends of 
Tracking sessions by Metrica from here - https://github.com/metrica-sports/sample-data

## The code

```{r Setup, cache=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 8, results = 'hide'}

library(CodaBonito)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)

rm(list = ls())

# Instructions
# You would have downloaded and saved the data from Github at some location on
# your system. In my case, it's /media/ask/Data/Personal/Projects/Personal/sample-data
# Replace the location below with the respective location from your machine
cDataRootFolder = '/media/ask/Data/Personal/Projects/Personal/sample-data/data/'
cGameName = 'Sample_Game_1'
nXLimit = 120
nYLimit = 80

```

```{r DataLoading, cache=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 8, results = 'hide'}

# loading the data in
lData = fParseTrackingDataBothTeams(
   cRootPath = cDataRootFolder,
   cGameName = cGameName,
   nXLimit = nXLimit,
   nYLimit = nYLimit,
   xMaxBB = 1,
   yMaxBB = 1
)

```


```{r PlottingASlice, cache=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 8, results = 'hide'}

# Instructions
# getting a random slice
# basically, a row from the tracking data
# you can choose to pick your own slice

dtEventSlice = lData$dtEventsData[
   # Frame == ( sample( Frame[which(Subtype == "ON TARGET-GOAL")], 1) )
   StartFrame == 99032
]

dtTrackingSlice = lData$dtTrackingData[ 
   # Frame <= ( sample( Frame[which(Subtype == "ON TARGET-GOAL")], 1) + 25 )
   Frame <= dtEventSlice[, StartFrame + 25]
][
   Frame >= max(Frame) - 125
][
   # Frame <= max(Frame) - 30
]

dtEventSlice = lData$dtEventsData[
   StartFrame %in% dtTrackingSlice[, Frame] &
   EndFrame %in% dtTrackingSlice[, Frame]
]


voronoiOutput = fDrawVoronoiFromTable(
   dtTrackingSlice[Frame == min(Frame)],
   nXLimit = nXLimit,
   nYLimit = nYLimit
)

print(voronoiOutput)

```


```{r PlottingMultipleFrames, cache=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 8, results = 'hide'}

voronoiOutput = fDrawVoronoiFromTable(
   dtTrackingSlice,
   nXLimit = nXLimit,
   nYLimit = nYLimit,
   UseOneFrameEvery = 1,
   DelayBetweenFrames = 5
)

if ( !interactive() ) {
   
   qwe = suppressWarnings(
      file.remove('./README_files/figure-markdown_strict/Voronoi.gif')
   )
   rm(qwe)

   qwe = file.copy(
      voronoiOutput,
      './README_files/figure-markdown_strict/Voronoi.gif'
   )

   rm(qwe)
   
}


```

I delibrately left that bit there where the player goes outside the pitch. I don't know what is the best strategy to depict that. Suggestions welcome.

What about adding some annotations?

```{r PlottingMultipleFramesWithAnnotations, cache=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 8, results = 'hide'}

voronoiOutput = fDrawVoronoiFromTable(
   dtTrackingSlice,
   nXLimit = nXLimit,
   nYLimit = nYLimit,
   UseOneFrameEvery = 1,
   DelayBetweenFrames = 5,
   markTrajectoryFor = c(
      'HomePlayer5',
      'HomePlayer4',
      'AwayPlayer17'
   ),
   markOffsideLineFor = list(
      c('Away', 'AwayPlayer25', min)
   ),
   markLineBetween = list(
      c('HomePlayer4','AwayPlayer17')
   )
)

if ( !interactive() ) {
   
   qwe = suppressWarnings(
      file.remove('./README_files/figure-markdown_strict/Voronoi.gif')
   )
   rm(qwe)

   qwe = file.copy(
      voronoiOutput,
      './README_files/figure-markdown_strict/VoronoiAnnotated.gif'
   )

   rm(qwe)
   
}


```

What's the line that the defense is holding?

Could the player making the cross have gotten closed quicker to prevent the cross from happening?

Note how the recipient of the cross is in an offside position but recovers in time for the cross.

## Next steps

Making it prettier, adding pitch outlines, etc.
